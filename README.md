<h2 class="nob not project">Finnish Language Trainer</h2>

<p class="not">
  I learn Finnish, and I also like C++ (counter arguments will not be
  listened to), so I combined the two to make the Finnish Language Trainer.
</p>
<p class="nob not">
  Some things that I wish to include / add in the future are:
</p>
<ul class="nob not">
  <li>
    Colors, since everything happens in the terminal, colors can help
    organising all the text, and it looks aesthetically pleasing.
  </li>
  <li>More grammar explainations.</li>
  <li>
    A way to practise numbers up to a million, but without having to type
    the first million numbers out in a file.
  </li>
</ul>
